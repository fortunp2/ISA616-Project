# 1. Introduction and Data Dictionary

Beach Tan Inc. is a major national franchiser of tanning salons. Their two main products include "UV Tans", which are offered in tanning beds or stand-up booths, and "Sunless Tans", which are provided via a spray-on solution and do not expose the user to any UV tans. 

In addition to their two methods of tanning, Beach Tan Inc. also sells specially formulated skin care products that can enhance the quality and duration of tanning results.

Beach Tan Inc. also offers a convenient membership program that gives clients more control over their decision-making power.

## 1.1 Reading in the data

The csv file containing the Beach Tan data resides in this project directory.

```{r}
# Loading the library that reads in csv files
library(readr)

# Reading in the Beach Tan dataset
beach <- read.csv("BeachTan/BeachTan.csv")

# Viewing the head of the data
head(beach)

```

## 1.2 Variable Overview

```{r}
# Viewing the structure of the data
str(beach)
```

This data frame of 11,041 observations and 12 variables was collected in 2014. According to the data dictionary, the variables in the model include:

* **UIDClient**: Client Indentification Number
* **UIDStoreLocation**: Store Identification Number (10 include in this data set)
* **Gender**: 0 = Female, 1 = Male
* **DateJoined**: Date the client joined (if non-member this is the date of their first tanning session)
* **DaysSinceJoined**: The number of days elapsed between DateJoined and 11/01/2014
* **MembershipType**: 0 = Non-Member, 1 = Monthly Membership, 2 = Annual Membership
* **MembershipLevel**: This variable corresponds to the strength and quality of tanning equipment offered to clients on what level of membership they have. Better equipment means faster tanning results. 0 = Non-Member, 1 = Fast, 2 = Faster, 3 = Fastest, 4 = Instant
* **Age**: The age of client in years
* **UVTans**: The number of UV Tans a client has received since joining Beach Tan
* **SunlessTans**: The number of Sunless Tans a client has received since joining Beach Tan
* **UpgradedRevenue**: The amount of extra money spent (in dollars) by members to tan in a higher level bed than what their regular membership would include.
* **RetailRevenue**: The amound of money spent (in dollars) by any client on various skin car lotions and products offered by Beach Tan

Looking at the structure of the Beach Tan data frame and understanding the information presented within the variables, it's clear that I will need to change the format of some of the variables. However, I will get to that in another section.

# 2. Analysis Preview and Revision of Business Value Proposition

In my original Business Value Proposition, I outlined how the two main products that I would deliver with my analysis were a predictive model to understand future clients' spending as well as a visualization dashboard to help non-members understand how their spending habits would be better suited if they were to become a member.

After working with this data set for some time, I've come to the conclusion that neither of those two products are feasible. The predictive model cannot be done for there are no new observations in which to predict their total Retail Revenue. And for the visualization dashboard, the data doesn't really explain how much members are saving versus non-members.

It is for these reasons that I have decided to change the product which I will be offering. Instead of a predictive model and visualization dashboard, I shall conduct two explanatory analyses in order to understand two things: how the variables explain Retail Revenue as Upgraded Revenue. 

The revised Business Value Propositions are included in the repository files.

# 3. Data Manipulation, Exploration and Preparation

## 3.1 Reformatting variables to factors

As I explained previously, there are a number of variables that need to be reformatted in order for the models to accurately analyze the data. The variables UIDStoreLocation, Gender, MembershipType, and MembershipLevel are currently formatted as numeric and must be changed to factors. The variable DateJoined is currently formatted as a character and needs to be changed to a date variable.

```{r}
# changing the following numeric variables to factors
beach$UIDStoreLocation <- as.factor(beach$UIDStoreLocation)
beach$Gender <- as.factor(beach$Gender)
beach$MembershipType <- as.factor(beach$MembershipType)
beach$MembershipLevel <- as.factor(beach$MembershipLevel)

# changing the following character variable to a date
beach$DateJoined <- as.Date(beach$DateJoined, "%m/%d/%Y")
```

## 3.2 Recoding factors to reflect their information

Next, I'm going to recode the new factors so that they say their actual level as opposed to just using a number that corresponds to their level. I will also recode the UIDStoreLocation variable so that its labels are more agreeable to code. When I create dummy variables for these factors later on, this will help make them easier to understand in the model output. 

The tidyverse package contains a variaty of packages that will assist me in my analysis. I will preface any use of a function with the package that it comes from. For example, the function `recode_factor` belongs to the dplyr package in the tidyverse family.

```{r}
# Recoding the factors in Gender
beach$Gender <- recode_factor(beach$Gender, 
                              "0" = "Female",
                              "1" = "Male")

# Recoding the factors in MemebershipType
beach$MembershipType <- recode_factor(beach$MembershipType,
                                      "0" = "Non-Member",
                                      "1" = "Monthly",
                                      "2" = "Annual")

# Recoding the factors in MembershipLevel
beach$MembershipLevel <- recode_factor(beach$MembershipLevel,
                                       "0" = "Non-Member",
                                       "1" = "Fast",
                                       "2" = "Faster",
                                       "3" = "Fastest",
                                       "4" = "Instant")

# Recoding the factors in UIDStoreLocation
beach$UIDStoreLocation <- recode_factor(beach$UIDStoreLocation,
                                         "1" = "A",
                                         "2" = "B",
                                         "3" = "C",
                                         "4" = "D",
                                         "5" = "E",
                                         "6" = "F",
                                         "7" = "G",
                                         "8" = "H",
                                         "9" = "I",
                                         "10" = "J")
```

## 3.3 Summary Visualizations/Removing Ununusal Observations

Now that the variables in the data are properly formatted, we can take an accurate overview of the data with help from the DataExplorer package. I want to first explore the distribution of missing values in the data set.

```{r}
# Loading the DataExplorer package
library(DataExplorer)

plot_missing(beach)
```

Gender and DaysSinceJoined are the only variables that have missing observations, but both of them have over 99.5% of their data, so it might not be a problem for now. 

Here is the distribution of continuous variables.

```{r}
# Distribution of the continuous variables
plot_histogram(beach)
```

There are a couple things I need to point out. First, UIDClient appears to be an unhelpful variable. This is likely due to the fact that each client has a unique ID number, making this information not useful when making a model. It's best to just remove UIDClient from the data.

```{r}
# The piping operator (%>%) and `select` functions belong to the dplyr package
beach <- beach %>%
  select(-UIDClient)
```

Second, the histogram for DaysSinceJoined appears to have values above 40,000, which indicates that some members/customers joined over 100 years ago. I want to understand what's going on here.

```{r}
# The `filter` function belongs to the dplyr package
filter(beach, DaysSinceJoined > 40000)
```

It's clear from this output that for each of these observations, DateJoined is missing. In fact, these are all of the 27 rows in which DateJoined is missing, and 27/11041 = 0.0024 or 0.24%. These rows could adversely affect the models, so it's a good idea to just remove them from the data.

```{r}
beach <- beach %>%
  filter(DaysSinceJoined < 40000)

hist(beach$DaysSinceJoined)
```

This distribution of DaysSinceJoined now looks more realistic.

I have decided to change DateJoined to become MonthJoined. Having each particular data stored in the data frame would complicate the models as each individual date would be a level. But if I collapse this into Months, there will only be 12 levels. Plus, this gives us a better picture of the trends of when in the year new customers are coming to Beach Tan, Inc.

To accomplish the task of extracting the month data from the DateJoined variable, I used the "lubridate" package.

```{r}
library(lubridate)

beach$MonthJoined <- month(beach$DateJoined, label = TRUE)

p1 <- ggplot(beach, aes(x = MonthJoined)) +
  geom_bar(color = "black", fill = "gold") +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0),
                     limits = c(0, 2000)) +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("") +
  labs(title = "Number of First-Time Customers/Membership Program Enrollments by Month") +
  theme_bw()

p1
```

This graph clearly shows that there is a major uptick in first-time customers coming to Beach Tan, Inc and/or customers enrolling in the membership program between February and May. Thus, I believe this variable will have some sort of impact in the models.

Because I created the variable MonthJoined, DateJoined will no longer be necessary.

```{r}
beach <- beach %>%
  select(-DateJoined)
```

Here are the distributions of the categorical variables.

```{r}
# Distribution of factors
plot_bar(beach)
```

It's clear that Females, Non-Members, and Monthly Membership customers make up the majority of the clientel of Beach Tan Inc. 

The Gender variable has a coule of N/A values, and there's no point in making an extra dummy variable for a level of a factor that has a miniscule number of obersvations, so I'm going to remove those rows as well.

```{r}
# The `na_omit` function belongs to the stats package.
beach <- na.omit(beach)
plot_missing(beach)
```

Now we have a data set with exactly 0 missing rows.

# 4. Aggregated Visualizations

The purpose of these visualizations is to analyze trends between either Retail Revenue or Upgrade Revenue (the response variables for the two models I will be making) and various predictor variables. While they won't have the same analytical power as the mdoels, they will still provide valuable insight for Beach Tan Inc. 

For these visualizations, I will be using functions from the `ggplot2` package from the `tidyverse` family.

## 4.1 Total Retail Revenue by Store Location

```{r}
# Aggregating Retail Revenue by Store Location
storesum <- aggregate(RetailRevenue~UIDStoreLocation, beach, sum)

# Creating a plot and assigning it to an object
p2 <- ggplot(storesum, aes(x = reorder(UIDStoreLocation, -RetailRevenue), y = RetailRevenue)) +
  geom_col(colour = "black", fill = "gold") +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0),
                     limits = c(0, 100001),
                     breaks = c(0, 25000, 50000, 75000, 100000)) +
  ylab("Retail Revenue ($)") +
  xlab("Store Location") +
  labs(title = "Total Retail Revenue by Store Location") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(
    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank()
  )

p2
```

It appears from this graph that Store B is perfoming the best by a considerable margin and Store G is performing the worst by a very large margin. If I were consulting the executives of Beach Tan Inc, I would advise them to consider closing Store G for it is lagging far behind the rest of the pack.

Averaging Retail Revenue by the number of customers each store brings in, I can see a similar story: Store G is simply not performing well.

```{r}
# Aggregating Average Retail Revenue by Store Location
storemean <- aggregate(RetailRevenue~UIDStoreLocation, beach, mean)

# Creating a plot and assigning it to an object
p3 <- ggplot(storemean, aes(x = reorder(UIDStoreLocation, -RetailRevenue), y = RetailRevenue)) +
  geom_col(colour = "black", fill = "gold") +
  ylab("Average Retail Revenue ($)") +
  xlab("Store Location") +
  labs(title = "Average Retail Revenue by Number of Clients at each Store Location") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(
    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank()
  )

p3
```


## 4.2 Total Retail Revenue by Membership Level

```{r}
# Aggregating Retail Revenue by Membership Level
levelsum <- aggregate(RetailRevenue~MembershipLevel, beach, sum)

# Creating a plot and assigning it to an object
p4 <- ggplot(levelsum, aes(x = reorder(MembershipLevel, -RetailRevenue), y = RetailRevenue)) +
  geom_col(colour = "black", fill = "gold") + 
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0),
                     limits = c(0, 155000),
                     breaks = c(0, 25000, 50000, 75000, 100000, 125000, 150000)) +
  ylab("Retail Revenue ($)") +
  xlab("Membership Level") +
  labs(title = "Total Retail Revenue by Membership Level") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(
    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank()
  )

p4
  
```

The "Fast" level is performing the best while the "Fastest" level is performing the worst. 

## 4.3 Total Retail Revenue by Membership Type

```{r}
# Aggregating Retail Revenue by Membership Type
typesum <- aggregate(RetailRevenue~MembershipType, beach, sum)

# Creating a plot and assigning it to an object
p5 <- ggplot(typesum, aes(x = reorder(MembershipType, -RetailRevenue), y = RetailRevenue)) +
  geom_col(colour = "black", fill = "gold") + 
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0),
                     limits = c(0, 450000),
                     breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 450000, by = 50000)) +
  ylab("Retail Revenue ($)") +
  xlab("Membership Type") +
  labs(title = "Total Retail Revenue by Membership Level") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(
    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank()
  )

p5
```

From this visualization, I can clearly see that customers with Monthly Memberships are far and away the drivers of Revenue for Beach Tan Inc. Their marketing team definitely needs to focus on them most and see if they can devise of promotions so that they convert to Annaul Memberships, which are lagging behind.

## 4.5 Total Upgrade Revenue by Membership Level

```{r}
# Aggregating Upgrade Revenue by Membership Level
levelsum1 <- aggregate(UpgradeRevenue~MembershipLevel, beach, sum)

# Creating a plot and assigning it to an object
p6 <- ggplot(levelsum1, aes(x = reorder(MembershipLevel, -UpgradeRevenue), y = UpgradeRevenue)) +
  geom_col(colour = "black", fill = "gold") + 
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0),
                     limits = c(0, 61000),
                     breaks = c(0, 10000, 20000, 30000, 40000, 50000, 60000, 70000)) +
  ylab("Upgrade Revenue ($)") +
  xlab("Membership Level") +
  labs(title = "Total Upgrade Revenue by Membership Level") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(
    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank()
  )

p6
```

Fast members appear to spending the most on upgrading. Members who've initially joined the program are already wanting better products but are unwilling to upgrade their membership. I wonder if this feature will show up in the model later.

## 4.6 Total Upgrade Revenue by Membership Type

```{r}
# Aggregating Upgrade Revenue by Membership Type
typesum1 <- aggregate(UpgradeRevenue~MembershipType, beach, sum)

# Creating a plot and assigning it to an object
p7 <- ggplot(typesum1, aes(x = reorder(MembershipType, -UpgradeRevenue), y = UpgradeRevenue)) +
  geom_col(colour = "black", fill = "gold") + 
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0),
                     limits = c(0, 110000),
                     breaks = c(0, 25000, 50000, 75000, 100000)) +
  ylab("Upgrade Revenue ($)") +
  xlab("Membership Level") +
  labs(title = "Total Upgrade Revenue by Membership Level") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(
    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank()
  )

p7
```

These results aren't as useful as the previous graph as Monthly Members are already driving most of the Retail Revenue, so it would make sense that they are also driving most of the Upgrade Revenue as well.

# 5. Model Preparation

## 5.1 Creating Dummy Variables

The lm() function in R automatically creates dummy variables for the factors in the data sets, so I will not have to manually create them.

## 5.2 Model Data Sets

Because I'm creating one model that explains Upgrade Revenue and another that explains Retail Revenue, I need to create two unique data sets for each model. 

The model explaining Retail Revenue should not include Ugrade Revenue, as that value is already inside Retail Revenue. It's also the response variable for the other model.The model explaining Upgrade Revenue should not include Retail Revenue, which is the response variable for the previous model.

```{r}
beachRetail <- beach %>%
  select(-UpgradeRevenue)

beachUpgrade <- beach %>%
  select(-RetailRevenue)
```

# 6. Model Output and Summary

I will now be fitting the two data sets to their respective models.

```{r}
# Creating linear model 1
modelRetail <- lm(RetailRevenue ~ ., data = beachRetail)

# Creating linear model 2
modelUpgrade <- lm(UpgradeRevenue ~ ., data = beachUpgrade)
```

## 6.1 Output of Model 1

```{r}
summary(modelRetail)
```


## 6.2 Output of Model 2

```{r}
summary(modelUpgrade)
```

The most important predictor in this model is UVTans. For an increase of one UV Tan (with everything else held constant), a customer on average spends $0.36 more on upgrades than not. 

The second-most important predictor is SunlessTans. For an increase of one Sunless tan (holding everything else constant), a customer on average spends $0.83 more than not.

The third-most important predictor is MembershipLevelFast. For every customer has a Membership Level Fast (holding everthing else constant), they will on average spend $18.51 more on upgrades than those who aren't Membership Level Fast.

Another interesting feature of this model is that Store I customers on average spend $10.86 on upgrades versus those who don't shop at Store I (holding everything else constant). The salespeople at Store I definitely deserve a raise.

The Multiple R-squared value in this model is 0.2412, meaning 24% of the variability is explained by this model. This model explains even less than the previous model, and so I'm even more likely to not use this model in order to predict new customers' habits on spending for upgraded products.

# 7. Conclusion

## 7.1 Evaluation of Model 1

In order to determine which variables are most important and useful in explaining Retail Revenue, I will be looking the t-value for each predictor. The further away from 0 a t-value is, the more likely it is important for the model.

The most important predictor in this model is UVTans. For an increase of one UV Tan (with everything else held constant), a customer is likely to spend $1.15 more than not. 

The second-most important predictor is MembershipLevelFast. For every customer has a Membership Level Fast (holding everthing else constant), they are likely to spend $54.79 less compared to those that don't.

The third-most important predictor is SunlessTans. For an increase of one Sunless tan (holding everything else constant), a customer is likely to spend $1.05 more than not.

Another interesting feature of this model is that Females are likely to spend $18.23 more than Males, holding everything else constant.

In evaluating this model, I will look at the Multiple R-squared value, which is a percentage value that explains how much of the variablilty in the data is explained by the model. With an Multiple R-squared value of 0.3457, 34% of the variability is explained by this model.

## 7.2 Evaluation of Model 2

The most important predictor in this model is UVTans. For an increase of one UV Tan (with everything else held constant), a customer on average spends $0.36 more on upgrades than not. 

The second-most important predictor is SunlessTans. For an increase of one Sunless tan (holding everything else constant), a customer on average spends $0.83 more than not.

The third-most important predictor is MembershipLevelFast. For every customer has a Membership Level Fast (holding everthing else constant), they will on average spend $18.51 more on upgrades than those who aren't Membership Level Fast.

Another interesting feature of this model is that Store I customers on average spend $10.86 on upgrades versus those who don't shop at Store I (holding everything else constant). The salespeople at Store I definitely deserve a raise.

The Multiple R-squared value in this model is 0.2412, meaning 24% of the variability is explained by this model. 

## 7.3 Recommendations for Beach Tan, Inc.

Based on the output of the models and the summary visualizations, I offer three suggestions for Beach Tan Inc. to consider:
* Focus efforts on converting Fast Level Members to Faster or higher as Beach Tan is losing money on those clients.
* Close Store G as it is probably running a loss and lags far behind the other stores.
* Females are spending more than males, so focus marketing efforts on them as well.

For customers of Beach Tan Inc., I suggest that:
* If your Membership Level is Fast, consider upgrading as you are spending much more money than everyone else on better quality tanning equipment
* Avoid Store I if you don't if you are content with you current level of tanning solutions.

However, while these conclusions are based on the models I constructed, I would not completely trust the accuracy of these models due to their low R-squared values. These models can be improved if more data and data types are added to the data set.
